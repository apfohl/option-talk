# Example


    public interface IApi {
        Person FindPerson(string name);
        Lightsaber FindLightsaber(int id);
    }
     
    public sealed class Person {
        public string Name { get; }
        public string Species { get; }
        public int Lightsaber { get; }
    }
     
    public sealed class Lightsaber {
        public int Id { get; }
        public string Color { get; }
    }


---

# Example

    var person = FindPerson("Luke Skywalker");
     
    if (person != null)
    {
        var lightsaber =
            FindLightsaber(person.Lightsaber);
         
        Console.WriteLine(lightsaber != null
            ? lightsaber.Color
            : "Lightsaber not found!");
    }

# What problems are we trying to solve?

-> ## -> Monads <-

---

# What exactly is a monad?

^
- Generic Type (Monad<T>)
^
- Container for your values
^
- Immutable
^
- Easy to get in and hard to get out
^
- Always defined state
^
- Methods to work consistently and
safely with contained values

---

# Simplest definition

^
## Type

- Struct or Class

^
## Creating a monad instance

- Constructor

^
## Bind the value

- A method to map the contained
value to a new monad instance

---

# Introducing Monad<T>

    public readonly struct Monad<T> {
^
      
        private readonly T instance;
^
      
        public Monad(T instance)
            => this.instance = instance;
^
      
        public Monad<TResult> Bind<TResult>(Func<T, Monad<TResult>> f)
            => f(instance);
      
    }

---

# Using Monad<T>

^
    var monad = new Monad<string>("May the force be with you!");
^
      
    monad.Bind(s => new Monad<string>($"{s} Live long and prosper!"));

^
\-> Hey Andreas, this is totally useless!

^
\-> You're right! But it serves as the foundation:

- Generic Type ✓
- Container for your values ✓
- Immutable ✓
- Easy to get in and yet impossible to get out ✓
- Always defined state ✓
- Methods to work consistently and
safely with contained values ✓

---

# What problems are we trying to solve?

- Context ✓
- Composition ✓
- Side effects
- NULL

# Making monads useful with Maybe<T>

^
- `Maybe<T>` is a monad like `Monad<T>`
^
- Instance can only be in two states:
^
  - Just T value
^
  - Nothing
^
- Needs two constructors:
^
  - `Maybe<T> Just(T value);`
^
  - `Maybe<T> Nothing();`
^
- Supports `Bind()` for composition
  - `Maybe<TResult> Bind<TResult>(Func<T, Maybe<TResult>> f);`

^
\-> Hey Andreas, that's still not useful!

---

# Introducing Match() AKA getting out of the monad

^
\-> After construction the value is monadic.
^

- In context
- Immutable
- Always defined state
- Easy to get in and hard to get out <-
^
- Provide a method to work consistent and safe
with the contained value
^

    TResult Match<TResult>(
        Func<T, TResult> just,
        Func<TResult> nothing
    );

---

# Using Match()

^
`Person FindPerson(string name);`
^

↓

`Maybe<Person> FindPerson(string name);`
^

\-> Success: `Maybe<string>.Just(new Person(…));`
^

\-> Failure: `Maybe<string>.Nothing();`
^


    TResult Match<TResult>(Func<T, TResult> just, Func<TResult> nothing);
^


    FindPerson("Luke Skywalker")
^
        .Match(
^
            person => Console.WriteLine(person.Species),
^
            () => Console.WriteLine("Person not found!")
        );

---

# Using Match()

`Person FindPerson(string name);`

↓

`Maybe<Person> FindPerson(string name);`

\-> Success: `Maybe<string>.Just(new Person(…));`

\-> Failure: `Maybe<string>.Nothing();`


    TResult Match<TResult>(Func<T, TResult> just, Func<TResult> nothing);


    Console.WriteLine(FindPerson("Luke Skywalker")
        .Match(
            person => person.Species,
            () => "Person not found!"
        )
    );

---

# Full Maybe<T> API Example

^
    public interface IApi {
        Maybe<Person> FindPerson(string name);
        Maybe<Lightsaber> FindLightsaber(int id);
    }
^

    Console.WriteLine(FindPerson("Luke Skywalker")
        .Match(
            person => FindLightsaber(person.Lightsaber)
                .Match(
                    lightsaber => lightsaber.Color,
                    () => "Lightsaber not found!"
                ),
            () => "Person not found!"
        )
    );
^

\-> Hey Andreas, that's pretty useful, but …
^

\-> … all this nesting becomes ugly very quickly!

---

# Unleash the power of Bind()

^
\-> As a monad `Maybe<T>` has to implement `bind()`.
^

`Maybe<TResult> Bind<TResult>(Func<T, Maybe<TResult>> f);`
^


    Console.WriteLine(FindPerson("Luke Skywalker")
^
        .Bind(
^
            p => FindLightsaber(p.Lightsaber)
        )
^
        .Match(
^
            lightsaber => lightsaber.Color,
^
            () => "Lightsaber not found!"
        )
    );
^

\-> Hey Andreas, that's what I'm looking for!

# Maybe<T> inside

^
    public readonly struct Maybe<T> {
^
        private T Instance { get; init; }
^
        private bool IsJust { get; init; }
^
     
        public static Maybe<T> Just(T instance)
            => new() { Instance = instance, IsJust = true };
^
        public static Maybe<T> Nothing()
            => new() { IsJust = false };
^
     
        public Maybe<TResult> Bind<TResult>(Func<T, Maybe<TResult>> f)
            => IsJust ? func(Instance) : Maybe<TResult>.Nothing();
^
     
        public TResult Match<TResult>(Func<T, TResult> j, Func<TResult> n)
            => IsJust ? j(Instance) : n();
    }

---

# Is there a real-world implementation?

\-> YES!

https://www.nuget.org/packages/Optional/

## Differences

- `Maybe<T>` is called `Option<T>`
- `Bind()` is called `FlatMap()`
- Loads more methods to work with your contained values
- LINQ query syntax support
- Provides another monad `Option<T, TException>` (Either-Monad)
